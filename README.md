  I needed a wireless access point with some network functions for home and I found this Chinese model at a good price in which OpenWRT   and some tools can be installed.


INTRODUCTION

  Defined as penetration testing “drop box”. Can be inconspicuously plugged into a network and provide the penetration tester remote       access to that network. It’s made up of a portable router running OpenWrt piggy-backed onto a battery pack.

    Key Features:
    
      Integrated Wired and Wireless connections
      Once plugged into a target network, the Mini-Pwner can establish an SSH tunnel through the target network, or can be accessed by         wifi. In addition, the MiniPwner can be configured as a wifi sniffer and logger – wardriving in your pocket.
      Low power consumption, no need to find a power outlet during the pen test.
      Multiple PenTesting Tools included
      tcpdump, nbtscan, netcat, nmap, kismet, karma, snort, aircrack-ng, ettercap-ng.. (Reverse shell, Reaver, WEP cracker, MDK3,             Password Sniffer, Network Sniffer, Wifi Nuke..) to name a few.
      Can be easily carried in a pocket, hidden behind a telephone, or hang from a jack by a short ethernet cable.

    Use Cases:
    
      War Walking / wireless auditing (5v 1.2a battery micro-usb conector)
      Penetration testing drop box
      Anonymizing middlebox (Tor Proxy)
      Phishing with captive portals (Evil Twin)
      Man In The Middle (MITM) SSL Proxy (Rogue AP)
      OpenVPN client

      Pivot box (reverse connection via SSH or OpenVPN)
      General network auditing, recon..
